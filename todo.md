## Section 1

- why is full circle = 360 degrees?
- get image for radians
- note that the diagram shows an angle of delta sigma, not theta
- maybe explain why we are using theta... DEFINITELY explain why we are using lambda + phi for longitude / latitude
- "surfaace"
	- this whole example kind of sucks, please replace

overall, whole section is a bit repetitive. Maybe let's derive radians from C = 2*pi*r ? not sure


## Section 2
- why longitude/latitude, why greek letters
- fix negatives in "real world location" example
- make seperate page for "real world latitude/longitude guessing game"
- add image for earth x y z axes
- MAYBE consider deriving the formulas first, then listing them out for xyz conversion

cos(θ) = adjacent side / hypotenuse
adjacent side = hypotenuse × cos(θ)
r = R × cos(φ)

- let's rewrite this. 1) we want to start with the formula. 2) we want to substitute in variables. 3) we want to do algebra to isolate the variable we want (in this case r). Let's make this change for the other formulas as well.

If we look down at the sphere from above (from the north pole), we see this circle of radius r, and longitude λ is the angle measured from the x-axis.

For a point on a circle of radius r at angle λ:

The x-coordinate is: r × cos(λ)
The y-coordinate is: r × sin(λ)

---

this is a bit too fast. We have a circle of radius r, and we know longitude lambda. Now let's set up a circle/triangle setup to understand why the x coordinate is r x cos(lambda)

## Section 3

- good proof of dot product formula, maybe add appendix: https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/3784740/proof-of-dot-product-formula

## Section 4

- let's put the cosine difference formula as an addendum. "If you look up the formula for spherical distance, you might notice that it looks slightly different. Using the cosine difference formula (a trig identity) we can simplify the formula a bit more."
