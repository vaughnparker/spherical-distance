# Latitude/Longitude Guessing Game

Before we dive into the math of converting coordinates to 3D space, let's build some intuition for what latitude and longitude actually *mean*.

You've probably seen coordinates like "40.7°N, 74.0°W" before, but do you have a gut feeling for what those numbers represent? This game will help you develop that intuition.

## What You'll Learn

By the end of this game, you'll be able to:
- Look at coordinates and immediately know which part of the world they're from
- Understand what the signs (positive/negative) tell you about location
- Get a rough sense of how latitude relates to climate
- Estimate coordinates for major cities

## How to Play

**Round 1:** I'll give you coordinates, you guess the location
- Look at the numbers and try to figure out which hemisphere and roughly where on Earth
- Don't peek at the answer until you've made your guess!

**Round 2:** I'll give you a city, you try to estimate its coordinates
- Don't worry about being exact—getting within 10-20 degrees is great!

Ready? Let's start!

## Key Patterns to Notice

After playing through these examples, you should notice:

- **Latitude ranges from -90° (South Pole) to +90° (North Pole)**
  - 0° is the equator
  - Values near 0° are tropical
  - Values near ±90° are polar

- **Longitude ranges from -180° to +180°**
  - 0° is the Prime Meridian (Greenwich, UK)
  - Negative values are west, positive are east
  - ±180° meet at the International Date Line in the Pacific

- **Latitude tells you climate, longitude tells you time zone!**
